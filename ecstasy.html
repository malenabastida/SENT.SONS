            <h1>Ecstasy: care to find the music that will make you the happiest</h1>
            <h4>January 4, 2020</h4>

            <section>
                <h3>Happy music = Music you like?</h3>
                <p>
                    Starting with the latter question, there are a few ways to figure out scientifically what happiness-inducing music might be.  The first would be to give people a CD containing music of different varieties, and measure their happiness before and after a week-long listening binge.  This hasn’t been done yet, to my knowledge.  The second way would be to hook people up to devices that measure their physiological state, and play them different types of music to see what happens.

                    When you listen to music, it’s processed in brain areas associated with, among other things; language, memory (short- and long-term), and emotion.  But when that music is something you really like, something that gives you chills, the brain areas involved in pleasure and reward light up too.

                    These reward circuits turn on when you eat, have sex, or do pretty much anything that’s naturally rewarding.  They are also activated directly by many drugs, which is partly why these drugs are so addictive.  In this study, brain activity when the music was played was similar to that of euphoria and pleasant emotions.  The areas the music activated are crammed with opioid receptors (eg., endorphins).  In fact, another study found that blocking these opioid receptors with a drug called naloxone reduces the chills people get from music.

                    But this is definitely all happening through music to your own taste – when the participants listened to ‘control’ music, that they didn’t choose themselves, there was less brain activity in these areas and fewer reports of chills.  So using music to bring pleasure and happiness requires a knowledge of your own personal tastes.

                    Therefore, finding *your* type of music is utterly important for your happiness.

                <h3>Music and Happiness: What the Science Says</h3>
                <p>
                    These internal goings on are all very interesting, but “music you like makes you happy” doesn’t really satisfy as an answer.  It’s obvious: of course the music we like makes us happy.  That’s why we like it.

                    What we’re really asking is, what type of music, on average, brings out the most positive emotion in people.  Accounting for taste is easy – you just average it out with large enough sample sizes, and look at the trends in the data.  This is how psychology studies are typically done, drowning out out individual differences with big sample sizes.

                    So, what’s the utilitarian approach to happiness music?  If you had a group of people, and you want to make the group a little happier overall using music, what’s your best bet?

                    Well, some studies compared different aspects of music with emotion and physiological responses.  Although there were some connections, for example, up-tempo music in a major key evoked similar responses to positive emotions, and consonant music was rated more pleasant than dissonant (3), as one paper pointed out, “this [preference for consonance] presumably indicates that listeners have internalized the tonal rules of music in their culture and react to violations of these rules.”

                <h3>So what kind of music can make you happier?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        More than any specific type of music, music that’s to your own taste is most likely to bring pleasant emotions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Songs that bring back happy memories may also work, if you reminisce while listening
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Live music will also work, if you take your friends along with you
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Failing all the above; if you’ve been exposed to western culture: consonant, up-tempo music in a major key, is the best choice
                    </li>
